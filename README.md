# Citi Bike Analysis

Citi Bike trip data from January to June 2020 was analysed to discover the impact of COVID 19 on the bike sharing service. 

# Overview of Trips

The total number of trips dipped consistently for the first four months of the year and saw a huge increase in May, as a result of the reopening of the economy after the lockdown. As expected, peak hours are 8AM and 6PM and peak days are Saturday and Sunday. Suprisingly, Tuesdays have the next highest number of trips, possibly because people are tired on Mondays after weekend activities.

Also, the average trip time is highest among females, however, that may be skewed as a large number of riders have not signified their gender.

Based on the total trip duration, Bike 42197 would most likely be needing repairs soon, as it has the highest count for the period - over 868 hours (3.125 million seconds).

# Overview of Stations

The most popular stations for starting a trip serve as the same for ending one. That may be attritubuted to proximity to the city centre as they are all closely located. Still, the full distribution of end stations have some outliers far away from the concentration of most other stations and they are primarily one-off trips.

# Overview of Users

There are more male than female riders, across both customer and subscriber rider types, although the number of female riders are steadily increasing. Customer riders increased considerably over the period, while subscriber riders decreased. This may be attributed to the uncertainty of riders on their ability to use their annual subscription due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Still, June has seen a slight increase in the number of subscriber rides and a slight decrease in that of customer rides as things slowly return to normal. Riders born in 1986 have the highest number of trips and most of the users' birth years are largely between 1977 and 1994, pegging most users as being in their twenties to fourties. Worthy of note, is that there is an abnormally high number of users born in 1986 with unkown gender. It looks like a glitch or the default age that people generally pick when they do not want to reveal their personal details. Regardless, this shows that Citi Bike has better data on its subscriber riders than customer riders.
